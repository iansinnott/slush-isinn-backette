# Backbone Marionette Project Base

_A starting point for building a complete SPA with Express, Backbone and Marionette._

What's included:

* Gulp (obviously)
* Express
* ESLint
* Logging via Morgan
* Auto-restart of dev server via Nodemon
* An existing app layout and collection to get you started

## Development Quick Start

```
gulp
```

This starts a server running on `localhost:3000`. All JS files will be watched for changes and the server will be automatically restarted. Note: If you're accessing your API via the browser it will not reload the window for you.

## Gulp tasks

The gulp structure for this project may be different that what you're used to. It's built in a modular fashion to avoid one large, unmaintainable Gulpfile. For more information on this specific implementation see [this great blogpost][blogpost].
